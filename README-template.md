## My process

I set up the page initially with HTML and then CSS Grid. Each testimonal is one individual grid item. I used Flexbox to align the photos with their respective names. Grid made it relatively simple to create a mobile-friendly version of this page. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I really enjoy using Grid. I would like to continue developing my skills in this area with more complex layouts. 

### Useful resources
